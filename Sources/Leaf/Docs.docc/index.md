# ``Leaf``

Leaf provides integrations between [LeafKit](https://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit) and [Viora](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) to make it easy to use Leaf templates in your Viora app. It provides extensions to make it easy to set up, configure and use Leaf as your renderer in Viora. It also conforms ``LeafRenderer`` to ``ViewRenderer`` so it can be used to render generic Views in Viora.
