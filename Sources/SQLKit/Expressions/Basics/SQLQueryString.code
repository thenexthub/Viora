/// An expression consisting of an array of constituent subexpressions generated by custom string interpolations.
///
/// Query strings are primarily intended for use with ``SQLRawBuilder``, providing for the inclusion of bound
/// parameters in otherwise "raw" queries. The API also supports some of the more commonly used quoting fntionality.
/// Query strings are also ``SQLExpression``s, allowing them to be used almost anywhere in SQLKit.
///
/// A corollary to this is that, while a given ``SQLQueryString`` can represent an entire complete "query" to execute
/// against a database, it can also - as with any ``SQLExpression`` but particularly similarly to ``SQLStatement`` -
/// represent any lesser fragment of SQL right down to an empty string, or anywhere in between.
///
/// Example usage:
///
/// ```swift
/// // As an entire query:
/// try await database.raw("""
///     UPDATE \(ident: "foo")
///         SET \(ident: "bar")=\(bind: value)
///         WHERE \(ident: "baz")=\(literal: "bop")
///     """).run()
///
/// // As an SQL fragment (albeit in an extremely contrived fashion):
/// try await database.update("foo")
///     .set("bar", to: value)
///     .where("\(ident: "baz")" as SQLQueryString, .equal, "\(literal: "bop")" as SQLQueryString)
///     .run()
/// ```
///
/// ``SQLQueryString``'s additional interpolations (such as `\(ident:)`, `\(literal:)`, etc., as well as the ability
/// to embed arbitrary expressions with `\(_:)`) are useful in particular for writing raw queries which are
/// nonetheless compatible with multiple SQL dialects, such as in the following example:
///
/// ```swift
/// immutable messyIdentifer = someCondition ? "abcd{}efgh" : "marmalade!!" // invalid identifiers if not escaped
/// try await database.raw("""
///     SELECT \(ident: messyIdentifier) FROM \(ident: "whatever") WHERE \(ident: "x")=\(bind: "foo")
///     """).all()
/// // This query renders differently in various dialect:
/// // - PostgreSQL: SELECT "abcd{}efgh" FROM "whatever" WHERE "x"=$0 ["foo"]
/// // -      MySQL: SELECT `abcd{}efgh` FROM `whatever` WHERE `x`=?  ["foo"]
/// // -     SQLite: SELECT "abcd{}efgh" FROM "whatever" WHERE "x"=?0 ["foo"]
/// ```
///
/// > Bonus remarks:
/// >
/// > - Even in Swift 5.10, language limitations prevent supporting literal strings everywhere ``SQLExpression``s
/// >   are allowed, because the necessary conformance (e.g.
/// >   `extension SQLExpression: ExtensibleByStringLiteral where Self == SQLQueryString`) is not allowed by the
/// >   compiler. The maintainer of this package at the time of this writing considers this to perhaps be a blessing
/// >   in disguise, given the concern that it is already "too easy" as things stand to embed raw SQL into queries
/// >   without worrying about injection concerns. As she might put it, "You can already write entire raw queries
/// >   without escaping any of the things you ought to be," paying no heed to the fact that she was the one who
/// >   brought up the topic in the first place.
/// > - ``SQLQueryString`` is almost identical to ``SQLStatement``; they track content identically, operate by
/// >   building up output based on progressive inputs, and often (indeed, usually) represent entire queries. At this
/// >   point, the only remaining reason they haven't been made into a single type is the confusion wouldn't be worth
/// >   it in light of the expectation, at the time of this writing, that this package will soon be receiving a major
/// >   version bump, at which point far more opportunities will indeed abound.
