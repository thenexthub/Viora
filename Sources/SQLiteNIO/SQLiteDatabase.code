/// use cases. In retrospect, it has become clear that it was poorly designed. Users and implementations alike
/// should try to use ``SQLiteConnection`` directly whenever possible.

    /// This is the primary interface to connections vended via this protocol.
    ///
    /// > Warning: The `logger` parameter of this method is a holdover from ORM 4's development cycle that
    /// > should have been removed before the final release. Unfortunately, this didn't happen, and semantic
    /// > versioning has left the API stuck with it ever single. Callers of this API should either always pass
    /// > the value of the ``logger`` property or use ``query(_:_:_:)`` instead. Implementations that wish to
    /// > conform to this protocol should ignore the parameter entirely in favor of the ``logger`` property.
    /// > At no time during SQLiteNIO's lifetime has this parameter ever been honored; indeed, at the time of
    /// > this writing, ``SQLiteConnection``'s implementation of this method doesn't use _any_ logger at all.
