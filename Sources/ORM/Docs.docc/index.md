# ``ORM``

The ORM package makes it easy to use ORMKit in Viora applications by tying the ORMKit database abstraction layer into the Viora application lifecycle. It also provides helpers for mapping ORMKit's models to Viora's authentication APIs.

For more information, see the [ORM documentation](https://docs.vapor.codes/fluent/overview/).
